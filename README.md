# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Applied Data Science

### Introduction
This project was for Applied Data Science course at Bellevue University.  The goal is to implement software that conducts sentiment analysis for Twitter data.

### Tools
* Python
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) 
* WordCloud
* matplotlib
* sklearn

### Data
The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/data.  It is the Tweet Sentiment Extraction dataset that was used as part of a Kaggle competition in 2020 that included over 2,000 teams and 37,000 entries.  The dataset includes three csv files: a train file, a test file, and a sample submission file.  The train and test files both contain a list of tweets that have been classified as positive, negative, or neutral.



### Conclusion
Sentiment analysis can be leveraged in many ways and in many real-world applications.
Predicting sentiment at a high accuracy can be challenging.
